# Flowdiagrams and Python
 This is where it all began. My first interaction with anything coding-related (so don't judge too much üòÅ)!  
 
 This project was made in my 4th year of HAVO at OSG De Hogeberg for my Information Science class.  
 This repository features my report (in pdf format) about all my assignments and some minor desk research about flow diagrams and programming.  
 
 If you want to look at my assignments, you can check out the assignments folder with all the needed data for each individual assignment.
